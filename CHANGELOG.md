## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-27

### Renamed — `model-story` → `epochix`

The PyPI name `model-story` was already taken, so the project ships under
**`epochix`** from this release onward. This is a one-time, breaking rename
done before any public PyPI / VS Code Marketplace listing — there is no
deprecation alias because there are no v0.1 / v0.2 installs in the wild.

**Migration (none expected in practice):**

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-26

A reliability + correctness release. Every section below covers a real bug
caught by running the system against a real YOLOv8n training run on an RTX
5080 (real GazeCapture eye-detection dataset, 30 epochs, mAP50 0.870).

### Security — secure-by-default

- **CORS lockdown** — default `EPOCHIX_CORS_ORIGINS` is now empty
  (same-origin only). Browser SOP protects the local dashboard from
  drive-by reads/writes by other tabs the user has open. The wildcard `*`
  is still available for explicit opt-in.
- **Write/delete endpoints gated** by `require_destructive` — when no
  `AUTH_TOKEN` is set, only loopback callers can DELETE runs, create runs,
  or push metric events. Remote writes always require a `Bearer` token.
- **API docs hidden by default** — `/api/docs` / `/api/redoc` /
  `/api/openapi.json` are not exposed unless `auth_token` is configured
  or `EPOCHIX_EXPOSE_DOCS=1` is set.
- **CLI warns** when binding `--host 0.0.0.0` without an auth token.
- **Field length caps** on `EventPushRequest` / `RunCreateRequest`.

### Scientific correctness

- **Percentage metrics normalised to [0, 1] at ingest** — accuracy logged
  as `87.6` is now stored as `0.876`. Grade thresholds / radar / cards
  all relied on this implicitly but it was never enforced.
- **Direction-aware phase detection** — `compute_phase()` takes a
  `lower_better` flag and computes relative improvement against the
  metric's real ideal. Loss-only runs no longer stall in Learning. When
  `total_epochs` is unknown the engine advances on real improvement.
- **Honest "Maturity"** — legacy `confidence = min(progress*2, 1)` was
  just training progress doubled, rendered under a "Confidence" label.
  Now carries an honest advancement scalar; UI relabelled to "Maturity".
- **BrainCanvas overfit halo** uses the real train/val gap from
  `skill_dimensions`, not the bogus progress proxy.
- **Network State weight edges** clearly labelled as schematic /
  illustrative, not measured weights.
- **Convergence threshold** is now scale-relative (slope ÷ series scale).
- **Skill radar caveat** — axes are correlated; shape is rhetorical.

### Parser robustness

- **ANSI escape codes stripped** before parsing. Ultralytics / Lightning /
  rich / tqdm emit `\x1b[K` + colour codes when stdout is piped — these
  landed at column 0 of training rows and broke the regex parsers.
- **Sniff window 50 → 200** so verbose preambles (model summary + AMP
  checks + dataset scan) don't bury the first training row.
- **`parser_used` / `task_type` / `primary_metric` persisted** after
  auto-detection (was only updated in memory, never written to the DB).
- **Live architecture detection** — fires inside the ingestion loop as
  soon as the header window fills, and broadcasts an `architecture` WS
  message so the Network State populates *during* live training (was
  only visible after the run finished).

### New features

- **`epochix demo` subcommand** — three bundled logs (`seq2seq`,
  `yolov8`, `keras`) ship in the wheel. One-command first-run experience.
- **`--ssh user@host:/path` ingester** — first-class SSH support. Spawns
  `ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=30 host 'tail -F -n +0
  <quoted-path>'` under the hood. Inherits `~/.ssh/config`, agent, keys;
  never sees passwords. Flags: `--ssh`, `--ssh-port`, `--ssh-identity`,
  `--ssh-opt`.
- **Engineer panel**: LR-schedule chart (log-y, auto-hidden when absent),
  multi-loss decomposition (box/cls/dfl overlaid for YOLO), best-epoch
  ★ markers on val curves.
- **Live Metrics** — TensorBoard-style scalar cards (value · ▲/▼ delta ·
  gradient sparkline) replaced the old horizontal bars.
- **Task-aware Skill Radar** — detection: mAP50, mAP50-95, Precision,
  Recall, Localisation; biometric: 1−EER, TAR, TAR@FAR=1e-3; gaze +
  regression: 1−MAE, 1−RMSE; NLP: 1−Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE.
- **Distributions panel** — value histograms alongside existing
  parameter-share and metric box-summaries.
- **Engineer panel detection fallbacks** — Loss chart synthesises
  `train loss = box+cls+dfl`; Accuracy chart uses mAP50 + mAP50-95;
  Overfitting Gap falls back to `precision − recall`.
- **Network State**: architecture chip compacts adjacent duplicate
  layer types (`Conv ×2 + C2f + …`); per-zone labels truncate with
  shorter aliases (`Pattern finder → Patterns`).
- **Multi-run comparison** at `/compare` with metric picker + EMA + legend.
- **Educational panel** ("In Plain English") — grade journey + "X in 10
  right" meter + practice-vs-test analogy. Direction inferred from data.
- **Training Diagnostics** — health gauge + overfit / convergence /
  stability / generalisation cards with status chips.
- **Phase Journey ribbon** — per-phase grade chips + connectors.

### VS Code extension

- **Reproducible packaging** — `vite.webview.config.js` produces flat
  `main.js` + `main.css` (Chart.js inlined for the strict CSP).
  `vscode:prepublish` rebuilds the shared frontend so `vsce package`
  is hermetic. `.vsix` is 124 KB clean.
- **Loader reads the built `index.html`** so the full app markup ships
  in the webview (was a bare `<div id=app>` before).
- **Frontend postMessage bridge** — gated on `window.__EPOCHIX_VSCODE__`;
  Standalone mode receives `init`/`frame`/`milestone`/`warning`/
  `complete`/`themeChange` from the StoryEngine.
- Extension now carries a **128×128 icon**, **LICENSE**, **README**, and
  **CHANGELOG** inside the `.vsix`. `.vscodeignore` excludes `**/*.map`.

### UX

- README quickstart now begins with `epochix demo` — newcomers see
  a populated dashboard in one command.
- Engineer accuracy fallback labels are honest (`mAP50` / `mAP50-95`,
  not the misleading "val acc").
- Network State weight legend moved out of the canvas into its own row
  so 3D slab top faces can't overlap it.

### Tests + tooling

- **+58 new tests**: 11 end-to-end fresh-install pipeline tests covering
  every model family (PL / Keras / HuggingFace / YOLOv8 / seq2seq /
  fingerprint / gaze) + a synthesised 50-epoch trajectory + HTTP-API
  smoke + `/api/compare` + `cmd_demo`; 16 SSH ingester tests (mocked
  subprocess, no real SSH needed); 9 security tests (CORS posture, docs
  visibility, loopback-vs-remote write gating); +2 phase tests + 3
  normalizer percent tests.
- **322 Python tests + 50 JS tests** passing on Python 3.13 / 3.14.
- **ruff + mypy --strict clean**.
- New classifiers: `Python :: 3.13`, `Topic :: Scientific/Engineering ::
  Visualization`, `Framework :: FastAPI`, `Typing :: Typed`,
  `Operating System :: OS Independent`.

### Fixed

- Stale `epochix batch training.log` in the README — there was no
  `batch` subcommand. Corrected to the implicit-default shorthand.
- `LearningMeter` docstring was stale.
- VS Code `.vscodeignore` `*.map` pattern only matched the root; bumped
  to `**/*.map`.

  FastAI, Accelerate, and a Universal fallback that handles arbitrary `key=value` / `key: value`
  and JSON-fragment lines

  (`val_accuracy`, `train_loss`, `mAP50`, `EER`, `MAE`, `perplexity`, `fid`, …)
- **LLM fallback parser** — optional Ollama/OpenAI/Anthropic integration for unknown formats
- **Plugin system** — four entry-point groups: `epochix.parsers`, `epochix.metaphor_packs`,
  `epochix.tasks`, `epochix.exporters`; third-party packages can extend any of them

#### Story engine
- **5 training phases** — Awakening → Learning → Understanding → Mastering → Polishing
