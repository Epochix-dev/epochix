# Roadmap

Open work, roughly in the order it is worth doing. Each item says what is
actually wrong and how it was measured, so nobody has to rediscover it.

Closed items live in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Rules that closed items
taught live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Blocked — not on us

- **Verify activation capture on Apple MPS / AMD ROCm.** There is no
  vendor-specific code and no device gating; capture uses PyTorch and Keras
  forward hooks, and it has been proven to work with every accelerator hidden.
  So it *should* work — but it has only been run on CUDA and CPU, and untested
  is not the same as supported. `epochix doctor` prints the result on whatever
  device it finds and asks for that line on an unverified backend. Needs
  hardware we do not have.
- **VS Code Marketplace verified publisher.** Eligibility opens around
  January 2027.

## Open

- **The PDF and comparison reports do not say how the grade was reached.**
  The dashboard card and the Markdown report do, from `StoryFrame.grade_basis`
  (0.7.29). The PDF cover and the comparison table carry the grade note but
  not the basis; a run graded on improvement reads there as if it were graded
  on a scale.
- **The extension notices a new `.epochix.yaml` only for the next run.** The
  thresholds file is read when a panel's engine is created, and the Python
  server is told its path when it starts. A file added or edited afterwards
  applies from the next run in that window (and, for stored runs, after the
  window is reloaded). Watching the file would close it.

## Decided — not doing

- **A Claude artifact.** One shipped until 0.7.21 and was withdrawn: a third,
  hand-written engine (last touched in 0.3.0) that graded regression on
  perplexity bands and animated random "activations". A new one is worth
  building only if it is generated from the Python engine's tables and
  replays `grading.golden.json` like the extension's engine — otherwise it is
  a fourth copy to drift.
- **PDFs for scripts beyond Latin and Arabic.** A Farsi report embeds
  Vazirmatn and shapes its text with uharfbuzz (the `pdf` extra); without the
  shaper it falls back to English chrome and says `pip install
  "epochix[pdf]"`. Any other script — CJK in a run name, say — cannot be drawn
  by either font, and a name made only of such characters is replaced by the
  run id rather than a row of question marks. `test_pdf_export.py` pins
  exactly where that line falls. Drawing it would mean bundling a font per
  script, or one very large one (a full CJK font is 15 MB or more, against
  Vazirmatn's ~245 KB); decided on 2026-09-28 not to grow the package for it.
  The HTML and Markdown exports carry every script already.

- **Universal (fallback) parser at 50k lines/sec.** It runs at ~31k on CI. The
  gate never ran until 0.7.13; it then measured 16.7k. Two output-identical
  passes (single-scan blanking in 0.7.13; line-profiled overhead in 0.7.15 —
  `try/except` for `contextlib.suppress`, cached name lookups, a fail-fast
  regex) took it to 31k. The largest remaining cost is Pydantic validation of
  `RawMetric`, which is part of the public plugin API (`docs/plugins.md`);
  swapping it for a faster type would silently drop validation for
  third-party parsers. Not worth it: 31k lines/sec reads a million-line log in
  about half a minute, and a live run prints a few lines per second. The
  gate's floor for this parser is 24k, to catch regressions; the framework
  parsers keep 50k (64k-129k on CI).

## Checked — not a problem

Claims that were filed as bugs, measured, and found wrong. Kept so they are
not filed again.

- *"The dashboard layout is locked to one screen."* It is not. `#app` is a
  fixed-height shell and `.app-body` scrolls inside it (`overflow-y: auto`) —
  measured live at **3510px of content in a 720px region**, about five
  screens. The claim came from reading `document.scrollHeight ===
  innerHeight`, which is simply how an app shell behaves, in a browser pane
  that was reporting a viewport of 0x0 at the time.
- *"Milestone surfaces are unreachable."* Milestones are rendered by
  `TimelineStory`, mounted through `JourneyPanel`. The run probed had zero
  milestones, so the DOM was empty for a legitimate reason.
